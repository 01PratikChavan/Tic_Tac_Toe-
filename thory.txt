the code you wrtie in syntax jxs in not understood by the browser but the build process convert the jsx into browser undertable code which can be implemented by the browser. 

example but that is not used mostly to 
React.createElement('div',{id:'content'},
            React.createElement('p',null,'Hello world') );

this is how we can write code but not neccessary used .
----------------------------------------

Fragment 
many nested div cause the redundancy in jsx syntax so react provides a way to handle this using 
import {Fragement} from react ;
<> 
</>
or 
<Fragment>
</Fragement>

returing multiple elements in jsx syntax is not valid we can use there fragment which can act as wrapper.

------------------------------------

when should split components 
one file should not contain all the function which deals with different things instead we need to make multiple subparts components to handle it effectively.

splitting components by the features and state
put different features in different component 

on custome component the attributes like id, class will not be forwarded automatically.
forwarding props to wrapper component
using ...props .
